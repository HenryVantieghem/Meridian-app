vercel --target staging

# Run smoke tests
npm run e2e:staging

# Verify staging deployment
curl -X GET https://staging.napoleon-ai.vercel.app/api/health
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Monitor deployment
vercel logs --prod

# Verify production deployment
curl -X GET https://napoleon-ai.vercel.app/api/health
```
